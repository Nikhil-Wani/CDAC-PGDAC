XPath Axes
An axis represents a relationship to the context (current) node, 
and is used to locate nodes relative to that node on the tree.

AxisName	        Result

ancestor	        Selects all ancestors (parent, grandparent, etc.) of the current node
ancestor-or-self	Selects all ancestors (parent, grandparent, etc.) of the current node and the current node itself
attribute	        Selects all attributes of the current node
child	            Selects all children of the current node
descendant	        Selects all descendants (children, grandchildren, etc.) of the current node
descendant-or-self	Selects all descendants (children, grandchildren, etc.) of the current node and the current node itself
following	        Selects everything in the document after the closing tag of the current node
following-sibling	Selects all siblings after the current node
namespace	        Selects all namespace nodes of the current node
parent	            Selects the parent of the current node
preceding	        Selects all nodes that appear before the current node in the document, except ancestors, attribute nodes and namespace nodes
preceding-sibling	Selects all siblings before the current node
self	            Selects the current node



Location Path Expression
A location path can be absolute or relative.

Example	                    Result
child::book	                Selects all book nodes that are children of the current node
attribute::lang	            Selects the lang attribute of the current node
child::*	                Selects all element children of the current node
attribute::*	            Selects all attributes of the current node
child::text()	            Selects all text node children of the current node
child::node()	            Selects all children of the current node
descendant::book	        Selects all book descendants of the current node
ancestor::book	               Selects all book ancestors of the current node
ancestor-or-self::book	Selects all book ancestors of the current node - and the current as well if it is a book node
child::*/child::price	Selects all price grandchildren of the current node



XPath Expression	            Result

/bookstore/book[1]	                Selects the first book element that is the child of the bookstore element
/bookstore/book[last()]	            Selects the last book element that is the child of the bookstore element
/bookstore/book[last()-1]	        Selects the last but one book element that is the child of the bookstore element
/bookstore/book[position()<3]	    Selects the first two book elements that are children of the bookstore element
//title[@lang]	                    Selects all the title elements that have an attribute named lang
//title[@lang='en']	                Selects all the title elements that have a "lang" attribute with a value of "en"
/bookstore/book[price>35.00]	    Selects all the book elements of the bookstore element that have a price element with a value greater than 35.00
/bookstore/book[price>35.00]/title	Selects all the title elements of the book elements of the bookstore element that have a price element with a value greater than 35.00





Selecting Nodes

Expression	        Description

nodename	        Selects all nodes with the name "nodename"
/	                Selects from the root node
//	                Selects nodes in the document from the current node that match the selection no matter where they are
.	                Selects the current node
..	                Selects the parent of the current node
@	                Selects attributes



Path                Expression	Result
bookstore	        Selects all nodes with the name "bookstore"
/bookstore	        Selects the root element bookstore
                    Note: If the path starts with a slash ( / ) it always represents an absolute path to an element!

bookstore/book	    Selects all book elements that are children of bookstore
//book	            Selects all book elements no matter where they are in the document
bookstore//book	    Selects all book elements that are descendant of the bookstore element, no matter where they are under the bookstore element
//@lang	            Selects all attributes that are named lang




Predicates
Predicates are used to find a specific node or a node that contains a specific value.

Predicates are always embedded in square brackets.

In the table below we have listed some path expressions with predicates and the result of the expressions:


Path                                Expression	Result
/bookstore/book[1]	                Selects the first book element that is the child of the bookstore element.
                                    Note: In IE 5,6,7,8,9 first node is[0], but according to W3C, it is [1]. To solve this problem in IE, set the SelectionLanguage to XPath:

                                    In JavaScript: xml.setProperty("SelectionLanguage","XPath");
/bookstore/book[last()]	            Selects the last book element that is the child of the bookstore element
/bookstore/book[last()-1]	        Selects the last but one book element that is the child of the bookstore element
/bookstore/book[position()<3]	    Selects the first two book elements that are children of the bookstore element
//title[@lang]	                    Selects all the title elements that have an attribute named lang
//title[@lang='en']	                Selects all the title elements that have a "lang" attribute with a value of "en"
/bookstore/book[price>35.00]	    Selects all the book elements of the bookstore element that have a price element with a value greater than 35.00
/bookstore/book[price>35.00]/title	Selects all the title elements of the book elements of the bookstore element that have a price element with a value greater than 35.00

XPath wildcards can be used to select unknown XML nodes.

Wildcard	            Description
*	                    Matches any element node
@*	                    Matches any attribute node
node()	                Matches any node of any kind


Path                    Expression	Result
/bookstore/*	        Selects all the child element nodes of the bookstore element
//*	                    Selects all elements in the document
//title[@*]	            Selects all title elements which have at least one attribute of any kind

Selecting Several Paths
By using the | operator in an XPath expression you can select several paths.
In the table below we have listed some path expressions and the result of the expressions:

Path                                Expression	Result
//book/title | //book/price	        Selects all the title AND price elements of all book elements
//title | //price	                Selects all the title AND price elements in the document
/bookstore/book/title | //price	    Selects all the title elements of the book element of the bookstore element AND all the price elements in the document
